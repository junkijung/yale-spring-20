Writing in the classical and Western traditions is supposed to have a voice and therefore to speak to its reader. A printed book generally speaks with a single voice and assumes a consistent character, a persona, before its audience. A printed book in today’s economy of writing must do more: it must speak to an economically viable or culturally important group of readers. Printing has helped to define and empower new groups of readers, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries: for example, the middle-class audience for the 19th-century British novel. But this achievement is also a limitation. An author must either write for one of the existing groups or seek to forge a new one, and the task of forging a new readership requires great talent and good luck. And even a new readership, brought together by shared interests in the author’s message, must be addressed with consistency. No publisher would accept a book that combined two vastly different subject matters: say, European history the marine biology of the Pacific, or Eskimo folklore and the principles of actuarial science. It would be hard to publish a book that was part fiction and part non-fiction—not a historical novel, a genre that is popular and has a well-defined audience, but let us say, a combination of essays and short stories that treat the same historical events. We might say that these hypothetical books lack unity and should not be published. Yet our definition of textual unity comes from the published work we have read or more generally from the current divisions of academic, literary, and scientific disciplines, which themselves both depend on and reinforce the economics of publishing. The material in a book must be homogeneous by the standard of some book-buying audience.
<p>This strict requirement of unity and homogeneity is relatively recent. In the Middle Ages, unrelated texts were often bound together, and texts were often added in the available space in a volume years or decades later. Even in the early centuries of printing, it was not unusual to put unrelated works between two covers. On heather hand, it is natural to think of any book, written or printed, as a verbal unit. For the book is a whysical unit; its pages are seen or glued together and then bound into a portable whole. Should not all the words inside proceed from one unified idea and send in the same rhetorical relationship to the reader?</p>
<p>Because an electronic text is not a physical artifact, there is no reason to give it the same conceptual unit as the printed book, no reason not to include disparate materials in one electronic network. The writer or editor need not envision and address only one homogeneous readership; an electronic book may speak with different voices to different readers (and each reader is a different reader each time he or she approaches a text). Thus, an electronic encyclopedia may address both the educated novice and the expert: its articles may be written on several levels of expertise to suit the needs and background of various readers. Our traditional canon of unity no longer applies to the electronic book, whose shadowy existence in electronic storage does not convey the same sense of physical unity. The text may reside on a diskette or in the computer’s internal memory, where it cannot be seen or directly touched by the reader. If the user is calling up a remote database, then the text may be hundreds or thousands of miles away and arrive only in covenant pieces through the telephone wires.</p>
<p>An electronic book can tailor itself to each reader’s needs. As the reader moves quickly or deliberately through the textual network, he or she seldom feels the inertia that pulls a reader through the pages of a printed book. A reader who consults the <i>New Work Times</i> Information Service does not want to read every article in the database; the student in computer-assisted instruction does not need or want to read every response the computer has to offer for every possible wrong answer. The reader exercises choice at every moment in the act of reading. Electronic reading is therefore a special instance of what economists now call “market segmentation.” In the classic industrial age, economies of scale required that products be homogeneous: each factory produced one or a few kinds of toothbrushes, soft drinks, or deodorants in vast quantities. In today’s more automated and flexible factories goods are tailored to segments of the buying public. Before the invention of photocomposition, the printing press was a classic industrial machine, producing large quantities of identical texts. Marshall McLuhan called printing the first example of the assembly line and mass production <span class="r7 link">(McLuhan, 1972, p. 124)</span>. Photocomposition and then the computer as photocomposer have already made printing more flexible, allowing publishers to target books to well-defined markets. However, a true electronic book goes further still, changing for each reader and with each reading.</p>
<p>The vanishing of the fixed text alters the nature of an audience’s shared experience in reading. All the readers of <i>Bleak House</i> could talk about the novel on the assumption that they had all read the same words. No two readers of an electronic book can make that assumption; they can only assume that they have traveled in the same textual network. Fixed printed texts can be made into a literary canon and therefore promote cultural unity. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the canon of literature was often taken as the definition of a liberal education, the goal was to give everyone the experience of reading the same texts—Shakespeare, Milton, Dickens, and so on. This ideal of cultural unity thorough a shared literary inheritance, which has received so many assaults in the 20th century, must now further suffer by the introduction of a new form of highly individualized writing and reading.</p>
<p>Critics accuse the computer of promoting homogeneity in our society, of producing uniformity through automation, but electronic reading and writing have just the opposite effect. The printing press was the great homogenizer of writing, whereas electronic technology makes texts particular and individual. An electronic book is a fragmentary and potential text, a series of self-contained units rather than an organic, developing whole. But fragmentation does not imply mere disintegration. Elements in the electronic writing space are not simply chaotic; they are instead in a perpetual state of reorganization. They form patterns, constellations, which are in constant danger of breaking down and combining into new patterns. This tension leads to a new definition of unity in writing, one hat may replace or supplement our traditional notions of the unity of voice an of analytic argument. The unity or coherence of an electronic text derives from the perpetually shifting relationship among all its verbal elements.</p>
